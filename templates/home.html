                            Stellar (/ˈstɛlə/) : of or relating to stars (and the universe in context) + -phile (/fʌɪl/) : denoting a person or thing having a fondness for a specified thing. 'Stellarophilez' is a website created to impart aspects of the innumerable wonders of astronomy and astrophysics. I am an amateur astrophysicist and a Full Stack Developer. I aspire to collaborate both disciplines and be able to implement latest software technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for the development of Space Science and Astronautics.

                            As we traverse through the 21st century, make our way through the technological era, trying to keep up with the modern age, we often get caught up in the mundane routines that leave us stressed out and frustrated. So, when you pause for a moment to catch your breath while running in the rat race, be sure to take a glance up above, towards the skies and stare at the entirety of everything that meets the eye. The beauty of the expanse and the abundance of matter that prevails beyond the Earth's exosphere is bound to leave you fascinated, stunned, and awe-inspired. The universe and everything it comprises teaches us much more than just science. One look at the deep dark night sky filled with starry twinkling stars, planets, nebulae, a streak of the milky way, and we realize just how gigantic and stupendous infinity is. The universe, humble itself, proposes to preach humility to one and all; and the fact that the entire pristine universe materialized from a singular point, attempts to make us realize that nothing is impossible if you work hard enough for it, that no matter how colossal our problems may seem, there is always a solution to each situation, an answer to every question, and no matter how small or weak you feel, you have the power to accomplish the toughest of your endeavours.
