                    Flare Stars are eruptive and energetic stars, which can drastically vary in brightness in short periods. Their intensity can increase in under a few minutes, and they emit large amounts of plasma in random directions. These Plasma flares are similar to solar flares (Flares emitted by the Sun) but highly severe. Flare stars are intrinsically faint, but have been found to distances of 1,000 light years from Earth. Flares in these Stars are likely caused due to magnetic events which accelerate charged particles, which in turn interact with magnetic fields to produce cyclotron and synchrotron radiations. UV Centi (Luyten 726-8). A Binary Flare Star in the constellation Cetus, has been defined as the archetype of flare Stars. Hence, Flare Stars are also known as UV Conti Stars. UV Centi is a Red Dwarf Star. Flare Stars have been. predominantly observe be Red Dwarf Stars, but recent surveillance has found that other star types may also be capable of producing similar flares. The closest Flare Star to Earth is called Proxima Centauri in the constellation Centaurus. Other known Flare Stars include Wolf 359, Barnard's Star, WX Ursae Majoris, TVLM513-46546, etc.

                    On April 23, 2014, NASA's Swift satellite detected the strongest, hottest, and longest-lasting sequence of stellar flares ever seen from a nearby red dwarf, DG Canum Venaticorum. The initial blast from this record-setting series of explosions was as much as 10,000 times more powerful than the largest solar flare ever recorded
