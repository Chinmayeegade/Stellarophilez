                    Icy frozen chunks of rock, water, dust particles, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, and ammonia originating in trans-Neptunian are called comets. These comets revolve around the Sun in highly eccentric elliptical orbits. When they come in close periphery of the Sun's heat radiation, the frozen layers gradually get warm and release gases. This process is called outgassing. The released gases combined with the prevailing solar winds result in the formation of a coma or visible atmosphere around the comet. As the comet travels around its orbit, the coma appears to be a faint misty tail trailing behind the comet. A comer's coma helps in distinguishing it from asteroids or meteorites. Comets are primarily classified into long-period, short-period, and hyperbolic comets based on the eccentricity of their orbits and periods of revolution around the Sun. Long-period comets presumably originate in the Oort cloud, whereas short-period comets originate in the Kuiper Belt. Hyperbolic comets are do not periodically return as they get flung into interstellar space*. The appearance of a comet is called an apparition. Although the total comet population estimates to be about a trillion, only approximately 5000 have been discovered.
