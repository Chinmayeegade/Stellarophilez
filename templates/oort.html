                                <p>
                    The Oort Cloud is a hypothetical conceptualization that predicts the existence of a massive spherical belt that orbits the Sun. This belt comprises huge objects covered in ice, frozen gas, and dust. The Oort Cloud lies in interstellar space*, beyond the heliopause* of our Solar system. Dutch astronomer John Oort was the first to put forth the possible existence of the Oort Cloud in 1950. The Oort Cloud is possibly the origin of numerous, giant long-period comets. These comets have occasionally yet briefly been spotted in the inner Solar System (For example, comets C/2012 S1 (ISON) and C/2013 A1 Siding Spring). Long-period comets leave behind a gas or dust trail because their icy surface gets vaporized by the Sun's heat radiations. The Oort cloud is yet to be observed, but its existence is widely accepted in the scientific community. The outer Oort cloud may have trillions of objects larger than 1 km (0.62 mi) and billions that measure 20 kilometers (12 mi) in diameter. The formation of the Oort Cloud possibly resulted from the original protoplanetary disc formation that took place approximately 4.6 billion years ago. It is often postulated that the objects in the Oort Cloud have materialized along with the Planets, Asteroid Belt*, and dwarf planets in our Solar System, but were ejected into long elliptical or parabolic objects because of gravitational interaction with gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn.
